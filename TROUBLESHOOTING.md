# 🔧 Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Fixed the 404 Error! ✅

The 404 error you encountered has been resolved. Here's what was fixed:

### Problem
- Vercel couldn't find the proper entry point for the Flask app
- File structure wasn't optimized for serverless deployment

### Solution
- ✅ Created `api/index.py` - Vercel's standard Python entry point
- ✅ Updated `vercel.json` with proper routing configuration
- ✅ Added serverless-compatible file handling with `tempfile`
- ✅ Reduced file size limit to 4MB (within Vercel's limits)
- ✅ Added proper cleanup for temporary files

## 📦 New Deployment Package

**Use this file:** `furniture-detection-app-fixed.zip`

This contains:
- ✅ `api/index.py` - Serverless-optimized Flask app
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Proper Vercel configuration
- ✅ `templates/index.html` - Mobile-first UI
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ✅ `.vercelignore` - Excludes unnecessary files

3. Upload zip file
4. **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Start Command**: `python api/index.py`
6. Add environment variable
7. Deploy!

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" error
**Solution**: Make sure `requirements.txt` is in the root directory

### Issue: "Template not found" error
**Solution**: Ensure `templates/` folder is included in deployment

### Issue: "File too large" error
**Solution**: Compress images before upload (max 4MB for Vercel)

### Issue: "Function timeout" error
**Solution**: Increase timeout in `vercel.json` (already set to 30s)

### Issue: Environment variable not working
**Solution**: 
- Set `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` in platform dashboard
- Redeploy after adding environment variables

## 📊 Platform Comparison

| Platform | File Limit | Timeout | Free Tier | Ease |
|----------|------------|---------|-----------|------|
| Vercel   | 4.5MB      | 30s     | 100GB/mo  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Railway  | 100MB      | 500s    | $5 credit | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Render   | 100MB      | 600s    | 750hrs/mo | ⭐⭐⭐ |

## 🎯 Expected Result

After successful deployment, your app will:
- ✅ Load the mobile-first interface
- ✅ Accept image uploads (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP)
- ✅ Process images with AI furniture detection
- ✅ Display results as an interactive inventory list
- ✅ Work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- ✅ Have automatic HTTPS and global CDN

## 🔍 Testing Your Deployment

1. **Homepage Test**: Visit your deployed URL - should show upload interface
2. **Upload Test**: Try uploading a furniture image
3. **Mobile Test**: Check on your phone - should be responsive
4. **Inventory Test**: Verify checkboxes and inventory format work

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you encounter any problems:

1. **Check Logs**: Most platforms show deployment logs
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` is set
3. **Try Alternative Platform**: If Vercel fails, try Railway or Render
4. **File Size**: Ensure uploaded images are under 4MB

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Homepage loads without 404 error
- ✅ File upload works
- ✅ AI detection processes images
- ✅ Inventory list displays with checkboxes
- ✅ Mobile interface is responsive

**The 404 error is now fixed!** Use `furniture-detection-app-fixed.zip` for deployment. 🚀
